### What is VCS or SCM?

Version control system and Source Control managment are one at the same. The terminologies are interchangeable.

Version control allows you to keep track of changes or additions to the project files by the various team members and revert to an older version of your project in case you think that you have messed things up.


### Benefits of Version Control System:

* Collaboration : Version control enables multiple team members to work on the same project simultaneously, without interfering with each other's work.
	* How ?     Each team member can create their own branch to work on specific feature or bug, and then merge their chnages into master branch
* Code Review: Version control systems allow for easy code review, where team members can review each other's code and suggest changes or improvements.
* Accountability: Version control tracks every change made to the project, along with who made the change and when.
*  Continuous integration and delivery: Version control can be integrated with continuous integration and delivery tools, allowing for automated testing, building, and deployment of the project.
* Experimentation: Version control allows you to experiment with new features or changes without affecting the stability of the main codebase.

**Version Control**Â is a system that records or keeps track of the changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall or go back to specific versions later.

There are 2 types of Version control system :
1) Centralized
2) Distributed

Centralized VCS :
	It works as client server model. It has one centaaized server and itt is accessible by number off clients
	Advantage of this typee is simplicity and ease of use.

Example :   Subversion, Googl Doc

If you obersve google doc whoever makes the changes to doc it will be refelcted.

The same thing haappens in Subversion where it has the project in central server and if you want to work on the project you have to connect to the network. Without network connection you can't do anything. If something happens to server we will loose the data.

Distributed VCS:
	It works on peer to peer approach. In this all the developer will have their own local file system. The features will be implemented locally on their machines

Advanteges:
	*  Faster access
	* Ability to work offline
	* does not depend on single server

Ex:  Git and Mercury
