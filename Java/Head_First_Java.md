## My Points

* Java is a strongly typed language
**Q: Why does everything have to be in a class?**

**A:** Java is an object-oriented (OO) language. It’s not like the old days when you had steam-driven compilers and wrote one monolithic source file with a pile of procedures. In [Chapter 2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-java/9781492091646/ch02.html#a_trip_to_objectville_classes_and_object), _A Trip to Objectville_, you’ll learn that a class is a blueprint for an object, and that nearly everything in Java is an object.
