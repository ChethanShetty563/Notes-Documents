### Defination of Database
	A database is nothing but set of realted information

### Examples of Databases

1) TelePhone Book : It is a databse of names, telephone number and address of all people living in one region
	1) Finding the person telephone number can be time consuming
	2) Telephone book is indexed only by last/first name which is theoretically fine but practically doesn't work
	3) The telephone book will not get updated even the people move out of the region

### History
1) Due to the drawbacks as seen above and also it applys for other storges as well (Patient records which is cumbersome in nature to maintain) some of the first Computer applications developed were database Systems which are computerized data storage
2) It is easy to store, search and retrieve the data
3) Early databases systems managed data were stored in magnetic tapes
4) Earlier data was stored in non relational way (EX: _hierarchical database system_, _network database system_)
5) In 1970 IBM Research lab published a paper that propsed data can be stored in tables
