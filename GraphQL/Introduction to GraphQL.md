What is GraphQL?

The technologies that allow client-server communication have evolved, the most common being is rest and soap

Currently most applications utilize REST due to the difficulties assocuiated with learning and understandoing teh SOAP

REST does not impose strict rules on how to implemnt the APIS

Difficulties associated with clients specifying exactly what they want from the server


GraphQL is a query language developed by FaceBook. It can perform the same operation as REST only more efficiently.

Developers can define the struture of the data that they wnat to expose using types
Also define how you can interact with data using queries

Advantages

Allows clients to request only what they want

Single Endpoint

Version less
Faster request and response
And it is strongly typed

Hierarchical queries : A client defines what response they want and what it should look like and response data will automatically resemble what the clinet requested.

Introspective :  With this Client knows exactly which operations are supported

Strongly typed : 

client specified queries
