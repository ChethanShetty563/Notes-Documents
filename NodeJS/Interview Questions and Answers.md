1.  What is Node.js and why is it important?
		1. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side, creating server-side applications with JavaScript. It is based on an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it lightweight and efficient.

Node.js is important because it allows developers to use a single programming language, JavaScript, for both client-side and server-side development. This can lead to faster development and a more consistent codebase. Additionally, Node.js has a large and active community that creates and maintains a wide variety of modules and packages, which makes it easy to add functionality to a Node.js application. The asynchronous, non-blocking nature of Node.js makes it well-suited for high-performance, real-time applications, such as chat applications and online games.
